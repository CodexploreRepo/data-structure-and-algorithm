# Part A. Algorithm
# 1. Recursion
-  Example: Factorial, Fibonacci Number, Euclidean Algorithm, Extended Euclidean Algorithm
# 2. Sorting
## 2.1. Insertion Sort
- Time Complexity: `O(n^2)`
```Python
def insertion_sort(A):
    for i in range(1, len(A)): #Start from the second the element to End of Array
        key = A[i] #Select A[i] as Key, and start to insert from j = i - 1 all the way to 0
        j = i - 1
        while (j >= 0 and key < A[j]):
            A[j+1] = A[j] #if A[j] > Key, swap A[j] to A[j+1] position
            j-=1
        A[j+1] = key #Place key to the right pos, which is A[j+1]
    return A
```
